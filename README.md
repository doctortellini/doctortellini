## About me
My name is Aitor. I'm a proud madrileÃ±o, but I currently call Valencia (Spain) my home. After several years of dedicating research to submit my Ph.D thesis, I've made a leap into the semiconductor industry, and haven't looked back since. The experience and skills I gained during those years in academia have greatly influenced my approach to coding, emphasizing precision, attention to detail and, specially, a love for continuous learning.
